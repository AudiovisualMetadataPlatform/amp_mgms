Yeah, the boundary conditions aren't being tested here. The idea was to generate
a sum over a window that might overlap the endpoints of an utterance, in which case it
was supposed to pad with zeros (functionally) which it does except here:

(change to)

	else
	  if (fr >=0 && fr <=S->data_size)
	    S->Kin[fr] = 0;

Upgrade adc2mfcc -> wave2mfcc.

Allows pipes/devices instead of just files.  Reads in blocks instead
of en-masse.  Uses the math coded by eht Eric Thayer which is more
reliable. Allows conversion of partial files.

 First recording of versions (duh) and things are very much out of hand.
 (27 June 1997 -- fixed DC offset and dither, now they actually do something

 DC offset is implemented with a causual filter instead of batch mode, and uses
 a fairly straightforward approximation to MAP estimate of mean, assuming
 a Gaussian signal.  This breaks down to a linear weighting of estimated mean
 for less than 10000 points, and full weighting afterwards

 Dither is now half-bit instead of single-bit in size.
